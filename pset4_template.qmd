    a.
    
    ```{python}
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # Read the file firstly
    df_2016 = pd.read_csv("D:/uchicago/24 fall/data/ps4/POS_File_Hospital_Non_Hospital_Facilities_Q4_2016.csv", low_memory = False)
    df_2016.head()

    # Count the number of short-term hospitals
    short_term_hos_2016 = df_2016[(df_2016['PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD'] == 1) & (df_2016['PRVDR_CTGRY_CD'] == 1)]
    print(len(short_term_hos_2016))
    ```

    From the result, we could see that the number of short-term hospitals from the dataset are 7245. This does not make sense.

    From the outer sources, we could see that, the total number of All U.S. Registered Hospitals are 5534, which is far lower than the result from dataset. (https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-02/2018-aha-hospital-fast-facts.pdf)

    Morevoer, we cannot find the exact term of 'short-term' hospital, but we did find a similary term, which is community hospital, the data of community hospitals in 2016 is 3385+1882=5267 (https://www.ahadata.com/hospitaltrendwatch/hospitalorganizationaltrends), which is very close to the number for the total number of registered hospitals in U.S. While the definition of community hospital is community hospitals included all non-federal, short-term general and specialty hospitals whose facilities and services are available to the public. Therefore, since the community hospital has included the number of short-term general and specialty hospitals. The number from the dataset is not making any sense since it far more exceeds the number for the other resouces.



    b. From my perspective, the differences could be the following reasons:
    1. The discrepancy may be due to variations in how short-term is defined across datasets. POS may include more specialized facilities under the short-term designatio taht AHA excludes.
    2. The POS dataset might include affiliated or multilocation entries separately, whereas AHA may consolidate these under single institutional entries.
    3. The POS dataset might have wrong data entry progress, making the dataset includes duplicate hospitals.
